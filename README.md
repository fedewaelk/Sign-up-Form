# Sign-up Form

## Description
This project is a sign-up form for an imaginary service from The Odin Project course.

The primary goal is to practice skills such as designing forms, using custom CSS styles, and basic client-side validation using pseudo-classes.

## Features

- **Sign-up form** with basic fields (name, email, password, confirm password).
- **Visually appealing design** including:
  - Customized background image.
  - External fonts.
  - Dynamic styles for input fields.
- **Basic client-side validation**:
  - Password fields display a red border when invalid.
  - Selected fields have a blue border and subtle shadow.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the form.
- **CSS3:** For visual design, including dynamic pseudo-classes.
- **JavaScript (optional):** For additional validation (to be implemented in future iterations).
